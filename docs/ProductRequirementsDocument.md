## Executive Summary
Nexus delivers a unified command center that orchestrates automated material flows across semiconductor and advanced manufacturing facilities. The system combines real-time monitoring, automated plan execution, and extensible integration points to help operations teams respond faster to incidents, increase throughput, and maintain audit-ready records.

## Problem Statement
Legacy scheduling tools and fragmented dashboards create blind spots for supervisors and automation engineers. Operators lack a consolidated view of lots, transports, and stockers, while integrations with third-party automation systems require bespoke, brittle connectors. This leads to slower response times, higher incident impact, and costly manual interventions.

## Goals
1. Provide a single operational control plane covering areas, locations, lots, transports, and stockers.
2. Automate plan orchestration with guardrails that allow human overrides when necessary.
3. Surface actionable, real-time insights through the Blazor-based portal with sub-two-second feedback.
4. Expose secure APIs and events that external automation partners can consume without custom builds.

## Non-Goals
- Building equipment-level PLC integrations (handled by partner systems).
- Delivering offline-first experiences beyond graceful degradation messaging.
- Providing advanced simulation or digital twin tooling in the initial release.

## Target Users & Personas
- **Production Supervisor**: Needs operational dashboards, controls for plan state, and rapid incident awareness.
- **Automation Engineer**: Configures orchestration rules, routes, and exception handling; integrates external services.
- **Operations Analyst**: Reviews historical telemetry for optimization and compliance reporting.
- **IT Administrator**: Oversees deployment, access management, and infrastructure posture.

## Use Cases
- Monitor facility-wide status and drill into specific areas or pieces of equipment.
- Trigger, pause, resume, and cancel transportation and production plans with confirmation flows.
- Receive and respond to alerts about lots at risk, equipment failures, or SLA breaches.
- Configure routing rules, automation policies, and escalation chains without redeploying services.
- Integrate third-party automation events via standardized gateway APIs and observe their downstream effects.

## User Stories
- As a Production Supervisor, I can acknowledge a plan failure notification and request automated reroute suggestions.
- As an Automation Engineer, I can create a new material routing policy and test it against staging data before activation.
- As an Operations Analyst, I can export orchestrator decision logs for a given lot to investigate an incident.
- As an IT Administrator, I can assign role-based permissions to staff and audit privileged actions.

## Functional Requirements
- Present real-time dashboards in Nexus.Portal with KPIs, alerts, and searchable lists of lots, transports, and stockers.
- Provide plan lifecycle controls (trigger, pause, resume, cancel) through Nexus.Gateway APIs and corresponding UI actions.
- Support rule configuration screens for automation engineers, persisting to PostgreSQL and emitting change events.
- Ingest external automation events via gateway endpoints, validate payloads, and forward to Redis Pub/Sub channels.
- Emit orchestrator events to connected clients within five seconds using SignalR or equivalent real-time transport.
- Record orchestration decisions, user actions, and system events in PostgreSQL with traceable identifiers.
- Enforce role-based access controls and integrate with identity providers through ASP.NET Core authentication middleware.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Dashboard interactions must return updated data within two seconds; orchestrator command acknowledgments within 500 ms.
- **Availability**: Maintain 99.5 percent uptime for orchestrator services measured monthly.
- **Scalability**: Allow horizontal scaling of portal and orchestrator instances through Docker Compose profiles and future Kubernetes manifests.
- **Reliability**: Queue orchestrator commands when Redis is unreachable and surface recovery workflows to supervisors.
- **Security**: Enforce TLS for external endpoints, audit privileged operations, and store secrets outside source control.
- **Usability**: Provide contextual help, inline validation, and activity feeds to minimize training overhead.

## Data & Integrations
- **Persistence**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) hosts plan definitions, audit logs, and configuration state.
- **Messaging**: Redis Pub/Sub transports events between services via Nexus.Infrastructure abstractions.
- **External Interfaces**: RESTful gateway APIs, future support for webhooks and gRPC based on partner needs.
- **Telemetry**: Prometheus and Loki capture metrics and logs; Grafana dashboards surface health metrics.

## Experience Design
- Landing page surfaces a geographic or logical map of areas and locations with health indicators.
- Command panel offers contextual actions for the selected entity, including preview of impacted lots and resources.
- Event timeline consolidates orchestrator decisions, operator interventions, and automation events chronologically.
- Alert center groups notifications by severity and provides quick actions such as acknowledge, escalate, or create incident ticket.

## Dependencies
- Nexus.Core, Nexus.Infrastructure, and Nexus.Shared libraries must expose stable domain models and event contracts.
- Docker Compose stack must include Redis, PostgreSQL, and observability services configured for local parity.
- Identity provider integration (e.g., Azure AD or Auth0) must be finalized for RBAC launch gate.

## Metrics
- Mean time to acknowledge critical alerts.
- Orchestrator throughput (plans/hour) and success rate.
- Portal daily active operators and session duration.
- External integration uptime and error rates.

## Launch Criteria
- Functional requirements validated through tests/Nexus.UnitTest and tests/Nexus.IntegrationTest suites with passing builds.
- Performance benchmark demonstrating sub-two-second dashboard updates under target load.
- Operator playbooks, training material, and runbooks published.
- Stakeholder sign-off from operations, automation engineering, and IT leadership.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Integration complexity**: Mitigate with adapter interfaces, sandbox endpoints, and certification checklists.
- **Data consistency**: Mitigate with idempotent handlers, reconciliation jobs, and periodic audits.
- **Operator adoption**: Mitigate with phased rollout, dedicated training, and in-product guides.
- **Infrastructure drift**: Mitigate with CI pipelines that validate Docker Compose and production manifests.

## Open Questions
- Required level of multilingual support for global deployments.
- Need for simulation tooling prior to plan activation.
- Compliance frameworks (ISO, OSHA, SEMI) that must inform reporting and audit features.
