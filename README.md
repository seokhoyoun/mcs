# Nexus

## Introduction
The **mcs** project (code: Nexus) is designed to manage real-time operations in automated environments such as semiconductor or warehouse systems.  
It leverages **Redis** for in-memory event-driven communication, **PostgreSQL (via Supabase)** for relational persistence, and **Blazor Server** for UI.  
The system follows an **event-driven architecture (EDA)** and is containerized using **Docker Compose** for easy deployment. [(https://portal.stone2on.cloud)](https://portal.stone2on.cloud)


Current active modules include:
- **Nexus.Core** – Domain models and services (areas, locations, lots, transports, stockers, etc.) with Redis-backed persistence.  
- **Nexus.Orchestrator** – Orchestration and coordination logic for lot/plan management, event handling, and system workflows.  
- **Nexus.Infrastructure** – Messaging (Redis Pub/Sub) and persistence implementations.  
- **Nexus.UI** – Blazor Server application for real-time monitoring and control.  

Removed modules:  
- `Nexus.Integrator` and `Nexus.Scheduler` were deprecated and replaced by consolidated orchestration services:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
